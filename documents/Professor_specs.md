# Professor Specs

This document contains basic Professor model specification, describing the data structure and related data models.

In order to develop Professor dashboard, 3 different data sources were used in this project:

  1. App events
  2. OAK data (backend data from MongoDB)
  3. Marketplace data

Data from all of the listed data sources is being stored in BigQuery, in Photomath'S DWH under the photomath-dwh-prod project.
